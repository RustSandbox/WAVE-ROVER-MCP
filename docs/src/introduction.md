Welcome to the LLM Robot Commander project! This documentation will guide you through everything you need to know about this innovative system that bridges the gap between natural language processing and robotic control.

## What is LLM Robot Commander?

LLM Robot Commander is a lightweight, high-performance Rust server that acts as a bridge between Large Language Models (LLMs) and physical robots. Our mission is to tear down the barriers of complex code and proprietary software, allowing anyone to command a robot using the most natural interface there is: language.

## ðŸš€ The Vision: A Conversation with Your Robot

Imagine telling your rover, "Go explore the garden and let me know what you see," and watching it happen. That's the future we're building. This project takes your natural language intent, translates it through an LLM into a precise command, and sends it to your robot in real-time.

This server is designed to control a simple, customizable rover, turning it from a programmable machine into an intelligent partner.

## Key Features

- **Intuitive Control**: Command your robot with words, not code
- **Real-time Feedback**: Get sensor data and status updates from your robot
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new commands and capabilities
- **High Performance**: Built with Rust for speed and reliability
- **MCP Protocol**: Uses the Model Context Protocol for seamless LLM integration

## How It Works

The system creates a seamless conversation between you, the LLM, and your robot:

1. **Command**: You give a command in plain English
2. **Translation**: An LLM interprets your intent using the tools this server provides
3. **Execution**: The server sends precise JSON commands to your robot
4. **Feedback**: The robot reports back with sensor data and status
